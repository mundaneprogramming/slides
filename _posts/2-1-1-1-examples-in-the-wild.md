[Scraping Craigslist for sold out concert tickets (gregreda.com)](http://www.gregreda.com/2014/07/27/scraping-craigslist-for-tickets/) 

> Lincoln Hall only holds about 500 people, so Craigslist postings were few and far between. When a post did pop up, I always ended up seeing it a couple hours after it was posted and was too late - the tickets had been sold. Noticing that my frustration was beginning to grow, I figured it was time to automate my Craigslist searches for tickets.

[What cool program to automate a daily task did you write?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/34982z/what_cool_program_to_automate_a_daily_task_did/)

- __A twilio script to tell me hello have a great day in the morning__ becuz every1 moved away :'( {% fragment %}
- Most of my online courses were nothing but flash videos of the prof reading powerpoint slides. So of course __I wrote a script to convert those videos to pdf slides and save myself an hour/course/week__. {% fragment %}
- My boss kept getting on to me for not logging my time to Jira. So wrote a program that pops a Tkinter window with a list of tickets that I have set to in progress and tickets that I modified at some point during the day. __I can then enter my time into input boxes on that window without ever even having to open Jira or remember my ticket numbers.__I now have the best time recording in the company, have not missed even an hour of logged time for the past 8 months.

- [How do you use python to automate tasks in life or at work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/308ucq/how_do_you_use_python_to_automate_tasks_in_life/)

> My brother in law has a "habit" of going to jail. All. The. Time. My wife wants to know when it happens, so I setup a script to poll the local jail inmate rosters, and send me an email when his name shows up. It works pretty well.

> My fiancee loves to cook for us but hates picking meals and making shopping lists. Now she and I get an email once a week with all of our meals for the coming week and the ingredients we need to buy.

> For example I made a library for running experiments in Python that basically handles the "boring stuff" like randomizing trials, leaving the experimenter to program whatever handles inside the trial itself (as opposed to other experiment libraries that try to handle everything from I/O to timing to experiment design. experimentator just does experiment design)...All this is mostly distraction/procastination from finishing my Ph.D. But I find myself enjoying making these libraries that facilitate research more than doing the research itself.
