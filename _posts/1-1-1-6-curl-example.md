## Downloading a URL


Nothing wrong with the old-fashioned browser way:

But try it at the command-line with [__curl__](http://curl.haxx.se/):

Sometimes you don't _want_ a browser &ndash; they can do _too_ much:

Programming is about knowing _exactly what you want_ and having the computer do _exactly that_

This is a little more higher level than __curl__, [and has been used to annoy the NSA](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/us/snowden-used-low-cost-tool-to-best-nsa.html), but it's simpler than __Save As..__ via browser.
